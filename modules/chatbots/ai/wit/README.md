Note:
==============
We are using [wit.ai](https://www.wit.ai) for the chatbot ai components.

We use the open source SDK [`wit-php`](https://github.com/tgallice/wit-php/blob/master/README.md) to connect to wit.ai via its HTTP APIs. 

## Install `wit-php` via Composer

```
$ composer require tgallice/wit-php
```

You should see 4 library folders under `vendor`:

```
    guzzlehttp  phpspec  psr  tgallice  
```
